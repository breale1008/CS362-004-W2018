Issue:	Council room card causes current player to draw +1 more card than expected
Details/steps to reproduce:
•	Create a scenario in which the council room card is played
•	Observe the number of cards in the current player’s hand before and after the card is played

The responsible code appears to be this section:
	//Each other player draws a card
	for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++)
	{
		//if ( i != currentPlayer )
		{
			drawCard(i, state);
		}
	}

	//+3 Cards
	//for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
	{
		drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	}
